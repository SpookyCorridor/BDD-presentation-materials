## Example materials

The example materials here include the javascript and spec code shown in the presentation. Node is required in order to run the tests. 

### installing node 

`sudo npm install npm -g`

### installing everything else 

for this setup all you have to do is run npm install and let package.json handle everything

```bash
npm install 
```

once everything is installed you can run your tests with `karma start`

- coverage/ contains code coverage results
- js/ contains your javascript code
- test/ contains your tests for javascript code
- karma.conf.js is Karma's basic configuration
